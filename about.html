                <h2>Why Does This Exist?</h2>
                <p>
                    One day, Jean-Michel looked at the Revelstoke Mountain Resort snow report and thought:
                    <em>"This is nice, but where are the sparklines? Where's the historical trend analysis?
                    How am I supposed to obsessively track forecast changes without a calendar view?"</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Like any reasonable person, he spent countless hours building this dashboard instead of
                    actually skiing. Priorities.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="about-section">
                <h2>Features Nobody Asked For</h2>
                <ul class="feature-list">
                    <li>Sparklines showing how forecasts change over time (because the mountain likes to tease us)</li>
                    <li>Color-coded forecast cards that turn red when dreams are crushed</li>
                    <li>TV mode for maximum snow-watching productivity at home</li>
                    <li>A scrolling ticker because this is clearly a financial trading floor for powder</li>
                    <li>Historical calendar view to relive past forecast disappointments</li>
                    <li>Season total tracking to quantify exactly how lucky (or unlucky) we've been</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="about-section">
                <h2>The Philosophy</h2>
                <p>
                    Regular people check the snow report once in the morning. Legends check it every 10 minutes
                    and cross-reference with multiple data sources. This dashboard is for the legends.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Remember:</strong> A forecast is just a suggestion. An obsessively tracked forecast
                    with historical trends is <em>science</em>.

                <p>
                    Built with caffeine, questionable life choices, and an unhealthy relationship with weather data.
                </p>
                <p class="tech-stack">
                    Powered by vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript because sometimes the old ways are the best ways.
                    Data from Revelstoke Mountain Resort. Stored in Upstash Redis because even snow data deserves
                    a good database.
